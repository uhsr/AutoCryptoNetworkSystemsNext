# AutoCryptoNetworkSystemsNext

## Description

A repository implementing a novel zero-knowledge proof aggregation scheme using recursive SNARKs over the Pasta curves, optimized for on-chain verification with a custom Solidity verifier contract.

## Features

- Integrates a decentralized oracle network for real-time price feeds from multiple exchanges.
- Employs a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism for enhanced network security and reliability.
- Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable private and anonymous transactions.
- Develops a cross-chain asset transfer protocol based on Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs).
- Implements a sharding architecture to improve transaction throughput and network scalability.
- Deploys a robust intrusion detection system using machine learning to identify and mitigate malicious activities.
- Supports hardware security modules (HSMs) for secure key management and cryptographic operations.
- Builds a modular smart contract framework with formal verification to ensure code correctness and security.
